# Dynamic Engineering Squad
Refactoring the Future

Our application is a gamified platform for reporting infrastructure issues. When users encounter a problem, they can take a photo, upload it to the app, and complete a brief report. Each submission earns points, and reported issues are displayed on a shared map where other users can view and verify them. As issues gain more verifications, the community is given the opportunity to name them—creating a sense of public visibility and social accountability that encourages municipalities to address problems quickly, before they gain widespread attention.
